## 1. Why ThingsDriver
ThingsDriver is a new methodology in how we can govern IoT devices. When we connect a device such as a printer to the local personal computer (PC), the PC requires installing the printer driver to get the printer configurations. ThingsDriver adopts the same concept, where IoT devices in the thingsDriver architecture are extendable from the cloud, and the cloud needs the IoT devices driver to govern them. Looking at IoT devices as extendable components from the cloud can pave the way for a collaborative IoT environment.

## 2. Quick Start
 ### Required Part
 We developed this repository as a proof of concept to the Thingsdriver idea. The demo version runs over [NodeMCU](https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html) and [Arduino UNO](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3) boards as an IoT node in addition to [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/) cloud, a public MQTT broker, as the cloud side.

 2. [Arduino UNO](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3) 
 3. Free broker on [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/)
 4. Some wires
 5. 5V-2A adapter
 6. USB 2.0 Cable Type A/B
 7. USB to Micro USB Cable wire

### 3. About Us:
Tamra is an incubated startup in the Ebni incubator. In 2018, Tamra won seed funding in the ICT track at the InnoEgypt program. Apart from the commercial side, one of the Co-founder is doing his Ph.D. degree in Ontario tech university at IoT lab. He developed ThingsDriver as a small gear on his thesis topic, Public Sensing.
